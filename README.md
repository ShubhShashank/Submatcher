# Using the program
Compile _(will include the jar file in the release soon, if you don't know to compile)_ and run the program and type in the path to your subtitles directory. Rest is history.

# Note
Currently it supports only the subs with the pattern **'S\*\*E\*\*'**. Will release support for other patterns soon.

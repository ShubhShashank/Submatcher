# Submatcher
As the title hints, this program is used to rename all your subtitles to their respective videos' names, thus saving you the frustration of renaming everything yourselves.

## Executing the code
Compile _(using Intellij IDEA)_ and run the program and type in the path to your subtitles directory. Rest is history.
